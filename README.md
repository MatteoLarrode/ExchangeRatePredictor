# Exchange Rates Analysis and Prediction
<p>
In this project, I analyse exchange rate changes and attempt to create a model predicting future rates. I extract data from an API and process it in Python using libraries such as 'requests', 'pandas', and 'matplotlib' among others. 
</p>
<p>
As a disclaimer, I am well aware that exchange rate prediction is an incredibly complex entreprise that even the most trained finance analysts struggle to undertake successfully. For this reason, my efforts to build a predictive model is not meant to guide consequential investment decisions. Rather,  it is a 'hands-on' attempt to learn essential skills and use key tools used in data analysis, applied to a problem that affects my everday life. 
</p>

## Rationale
<p>
As an expatriate student, my family supports me by regularly sending money. This money, earned in euros is subject to the fluctutions of exchange rates. Finding the correct window of opportunity, where exchange rates are optimal, can save a consequential amount of money. At this game, my father has essentially played a guessing name up until now. 
</p>
My objective is to inform his decision making in order to optimise those transfers and therefore save money. <br/>
Additionally, predicting exchange rates could also be helpful in the budgeting of my family's worldwide travels. 

## Explore exchange rates fluctuations

### Pulling the exchange rates
API:
-description-<br/>
limits(limited number of API calls, can only pull data for one year) /// 


### Studying the fluctuations of exchange rates

## Predicting exchange rates changes

### ARIMA model: use historical data
Analysis of time series - but LIMITATIONS

### Include other dependent variables: use EDA takeawaya


## Personal takeaways of this project

### Skills developed 

### Thinking as a data analyst
