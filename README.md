# Exchange Rates Analysis and Prediction
<p>
In this project, I analyse exchange rate changes and attempt to create a model predicting future rates. I extract data from an API and process it in Python using libraries such as 'requests', 'pandas', and 'matplotlib' among others. 
</p>
<p>
As a disclaimer, I am well aware that exchange rate prediction is an incredibly complex entreprise that even the most trained finance analysts struggle to undertake successfully. For this reason, my efforts to build a predictive model is not meant to guide consequential investment decisions. Rather,  it is a 'hands-on' attempt to learn essential skills and use key tools used in data analysis, applied to a problem that affects my everday life.

## Rationale
Family sending me money from France to the US 

## Explore exchange rates fluctuations

### Pulling the exchange rates
API:
-description-<br/>
limits(limited number of API calls, can only pull data for one year) /// 


### Studying the fluctuations of exchange rates

## Predicting exchange rates changes

### ARIMA model: use historical data
Analysis of time series - but LIMITATIONS

### Include other dependent variables: use EDA takeawaya


## Personal takeaways of this project

### Skills developed 

### Thinking as a data analyst
